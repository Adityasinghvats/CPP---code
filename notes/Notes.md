# Sorting Basics
- Inbuilt sort has time complexity of 0(nlogn).

- To reverse sort use sort(end,begin) then reverse(end,start).

---
# Deep Copy vs. Shallow Copy
- It creates a copy of the same value , on changing the copied value , the original value is not changed.

---
# Why is vector more efficient than creating new array each time?
- When a vector is filled , the vector is not increased for each new element , instead it is increased in mutiples of 2 , so until the filled size is not more then capacity, we don`t need to increase the size of vector.

---
# Supports Multilevel and Multiple inheritance and Virtual Base Classes

---
# and (&&) , or(||) , not(!)

---
# Convert array to vector
- If array is `int arr[] = {}` of size `n` then `vector<int> v(arr,arr+n)`

--- 
# Very important to identify problems if they can solve dusing greedy or DP
- Because in most cases DP questions cannot be solved using Greedy.
