Matrix chain mutltiplication
- Given an array of dimensions of matrics {40, 20, 30, 10, 30}, where dimesnion of a matrix is arr[i-1] x arr[i]. Find efficient way to multioly these matrics so that the number of multiplications is minimum.
- Here we get 4 matrics A<>, B<>, C<>, D<>
- To multiply 2 matrics A<mxn> and B<nxk>, We have m X N X k. E.g for two 2x2 matrics there will be 8 total multiplications.
